## Best Practices for Cross-Functional Collaboration

### Early Involvement
- Involve relevant roles early in the project lifecycle
- Don't wait until handoff to bring in critical perspectives
- Security, accessibility, and infrastructure should be considered from the start

### Clear Documentation
- Document decisions and rationale
- Maintain up-to-date handoff artifacts
- Use shared tools and repositories for collaboration

### Regular Check-ins
- Establish recurring touchpoints between roles
- Don't rely solely on scheduled meetings - use async communication
- Keep communication channels open and responsive

### Mutual Understanding
- Understand the goals and constraints of other roles
- Ask questions and seek to understand before making assumptions
- Build empathy for the challenges faced by collaborators

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly reflect on collaboration effectiveness
- Identify and address friction points in handoffs
- Share learnings and iterate on processes

## Escalation Paths

When issues or blockers arise, follow these escalation paths:

1. **Technical Issues**: Developer → Tech Lead → Engineering Manager
2. **Product Decisions**: Product Manager → Product Lead → VP Product
3. **Security Concerns**: Security Champion → Security Team → CISO
4. **Infrastructure Issues**: DevOps Engineer → Infrastructure Lead → VP Engineering
5. **Customer Issues**: Support Lead → Product Manager → Customer Success Manager
6. **Design Conflicts**: UX Designer → Design Lead → Product Manager

For cross-functional conflicts or blockers involving multiple roles, escalate to the Project Manager who will facilitate resolution.
